  <h1>La Bandera</h1>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>La bandera’s namesake is the tricolor Dominican flag with its distinctive red, white and blue design framing the national insignia. "La Bandera" food is mainly composed of Dominican rice and beans with chicken, the red represented by the beans, the white by the rice, and – with a splash of poetic and culinary license here – the meat – usually chicken or beef – represents the third color. There's always also some type of salad to go with them.</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol><b>Arroz Blanco</b> <hr>
  <li>Heating the water: In a medium aluminum pot (Amazon affiliate link) (minimum 2.5 liters [0.5 gal] capacity) heat 3 tablespoons of oil over medium heat, add the salt. When the oil is a little hot add 6 cups [1.4 liters] of water, taking care not to splash. If you use another type of pot, just combine oil, salt, and water and heat over medium heat.</li>

  <li>Adding the rice: When the water reaches boiling point, add the rice and cook, stirring regularly to prevent it from sticking to the bottom.</li>

  <li> Covering the rice: When the water has evaporated, cover with the lid and cook over very low heat (but enough to generate steam) for 15 minutes. Remove the lid, stir, add the remaining oil and cover again. This oil will help the rice to shine, and the concón will be crispier.</li>

  <li>In 5 more minutes taste the rice, it should be firm but soft inside. If necessary cover again and leave for another 5 minutes on low heat.</li>

  <li>Serving: As soon as the rice is ready, remove it from the pot and place it in a serving dish (this prevents the concón from getting soggy). Scrape off the concón (rice stuck to the bottom) and serve on the side.</li>

</ol>

<ol><b>Habichuelas Guisadas</b> <hr >

  <li>If you are using dry beans. Soak the beans overnight. Remove the beans from the soaking water and boil in fresh water until they are very soft (may take up to an hour, or about 20 minutes in a pressure cooker. </li>
  <li> How to make habichuelas guisadas. Separate the beans from the boiling water. Set both aside.</li>
  <li>In a pot heat the oil over medium heat. Add oregano, bell pepper, onion, garlic, auyama, tomato sauce, celery, thyme and cilantro. Cook and stir for half a minute. Add the beans and simmer for two minutes.</li>
  <li>Pour in 4 cups of the water in which the beans boiled (complete with fresh water if necessary). Once it reaches a rolling boil, lightly mashed the beans with a potato masher to break them out of the skin and making creamier habichuelas. Cook until it reaches a creamy consistency.</li>
  <li>Remove the chunks of onion, as well as any stray twigs or large bits of herbs if you used fresh herbs. Season with salt to taste.</li>
  <li>Serve with the other components of La Bandera Dominicana.</li>
</ol>

<ol><b>Pollo Guisado</b> <hr>
  <li>Prep chicken: Cut the chicken into small pieces and place in a bowl that has a lid. Season the chicken pieces with the lime juice.</li>

  <li>Season chicken: Mix in the chicken, oregano, onion, celery, salt, and garlic. Marinate for 30 minutes.</li>

  <li>Brown chicken: In a pot heat the oil over medium heat, add sugar, and wait until it browns. Add the chicken (reserve all the other things in the marinade for use in a later step) and cook and stir until the meat is light brown.</li>

  <li>Braise: Add 2 tablespoons of water. Cover and simmer over medium heat for 15 minutes, stirring and adding water by the tablespoon as it becomes necessary to prevent it from burning.</li>

  <li>Add vegetables: Stir in the vegetables that you had set aside from marinating the chicken, plus cubanelle pepper, tomatoes, and olives. Cover, and simmer until the vegetables are cooked through, adding water by the tablespoon and stirring as it becomes necessary.</li>

  <li>Make sauce: Add the tomato sauce and half a cup of water, simmer over low heat to produce a light sauce. The vegetables will be very soft, the sauce a bit thick, and the chicken fall-off-the-bone tender. Add fresh cilantro. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>

  <li>Serve: Serve with arroz blanco, a side dish (or salad), and beans. It also goes great with moro de habichuelas.</li>
</ol>

<ol><b>Ensalada Verde</b> <hr>
  <li>Arrange: Sprinkle the sliced beet with a pinch of   sugar. Arrange the vegetables on a platter, including   the beetroot.</li>

  <li>Mixing vinaigrette: Combine vinegar, and olive  oil. Add salt to taste and stir to combine.</li>

  <li>Serving: Serve salad alongside the vinaigrette. If it will be served later, cover and chill.</li>
